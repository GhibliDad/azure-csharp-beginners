The Service Bus features in Azure Portal are still quite rudimentary (even after over a decade). There are other third party open source tools that can be used with better features. 

Service Bus Explorer:

Service Bus Explorer extension for VS Code:
https://github.com/DigitalMolecules/vscode-servicebus-explorer

These two tools share the name but are not related. Nor are they related to the `Service Bus Explorer (preview)` feature in Azure Portal.
