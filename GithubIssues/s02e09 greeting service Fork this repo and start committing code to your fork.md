From now on we will need to commit our code to Github repos. Fork this repo and start pushing your code to your own fork.

### Goal
- Source control
- Github
- Git
- Branches
- Pull request

### Steps
1. Fork this repo to your own account
2. All logic is contained in the `main` branch (in older repos this branch might be named `master` instead of `main`)
3. Push your code to you own fork
4. Create a new branch
5. Update some logic
6. Create a pull request from the new branch into `main` and check review it
7. Merge or close the `PR` without merging
