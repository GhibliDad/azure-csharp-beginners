# Welcome to azure-csharp-beginners

This repo contains a backlog of all excercises that we will work on in this programme. Check out the `Issues` in this repo. At the beginning of every week we'll plan a `milestone` containing the `issues` that we'll work on that week and at the end of the week we'll some sort of demo and retrospective.

The excercises are grouped in `seasons` and `episodes` just like a TV show. We will start with season 1: `s01` and episode 1: `e01` and progress from there.

There will be corresponding `branches` that contains one solution. Look up the solution if you get stuck, want inspiration, want to see another way to solve the problem etc.
